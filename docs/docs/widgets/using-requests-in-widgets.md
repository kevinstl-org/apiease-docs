# Using Requests in Widgets

Widgets can call APIEase requests. The widget runs in the browser, but the request runs on the server. This separation keeps integrations secure by keeping credentials and private logic off the storefront.

Before adding the call, add the **Widget Calls** trigger to the request. The widget, request, and theme placement are separate: the widget contains the storefront UI, the request performs the server-side work, and an [App Block or App Embed](./widget-app-extensions.md) determines where the widget loads.

## Configure a request call
1. Get the handle for the request you want to run.
2. In the widget edit page, the **Liquid** field is required; you can use a simple placeholder like `<div></div>`.
3. Paste the JavaScript below into the widget's **JavaScript** field to call the APIEase integration endpoint with `fetch` and read the JSON response:

```js
const queryParams = new URLSearchParams({
  requestId: 'product-details-proxy',
});

fetch('/apps/apiease/integration/caller/call?' + queryParams)
  .then(function (response) {
    return response.json();
  })
  .then(function (jsonResponse) {
    console.log(jsonResponse);
  });
```

## Security warning
Never place sensitive credentials (API keys, access tokens, passwords) in a widget. Widgets are delivered to the browser and are inspectable. Configure credentials inside the APIEase request so they are stored securely and only used on the server.
