# HTTP Requests

HTTP API requests are highly configurable with many options.  HTTP requests allow you to securely call any external API directly from your Shopify store or through other trigger methods such as webhooks, storefront app proxy, or a recurring schedule.

## HTTP request fields

- **Name**: Optional display name.
- **Handle**: Stable identifier used by [chained requests](../request-parameters/chained-requests.md), storefront calls, `apiease-cli`, and the public API.
- **Type**: Choose **HTTP** for a standard API call to an external service.
- **Address**: Enter the full endpoint URL from the provider's API documentation (for example, `https://api.example.com/data`). Keep values that belong in the query string, path placeholders, or body in their matching parameter locations.
- **Method**: Choose the operation required by the provider: GET, POST, DELETE, PUT, PATCH, or OPTIONS.
- **Parameters ([?](../request-parameters/in-app-vs-dynamic.md))**:
  - **Headers**: Add required headers (Authorization, Content-Type, etc.).
  - **Query parameters**: Values to include in the query string.
  - **Body**: Add the payload for methods such as POST, PUT, or PATCH. APIEase supports standard JSON bodies and [form URL-encoded bodies](../request-parameters/form-urlencoded-bodies.md).
  - **Path**: Dynamic [path variables](../request-parameters/path-variables.md) to substitute into the address.
  - **System**: Used by APIEase for features such as [Customer Authentication](../customer-authenticated-requests.md).
  - You can provide [in app parameters](../request-parameters/in-app-vs-dynamic.md) or pass [dynamic embedded parameters](../request-parameters/dynamic-embedded-parameters/dynamic-embedded-parameters-overview.md) from the storefront.
  - If the request includes credentials or API keys, mark them as **Sensitive** so they remain encrypted and never shown in the storefront or admin UI.
  


- **Triggers ([?](../triggers/webhooks/trigger-requests-from-a-webhook.md))**: Choose how the request should be triggered:
  - Automatically via [webhook](../triggers/webhooks/trigger-requests-from-a-webhook.md)
  - On a recurring schedule using [cron](../triggers/cron-schedule.md)
  - As an endpoint served by APIEase via [Proxy Endpoints](../triggers/proxy-endpoint.md)
  - [Remote Calls](../triggers/calling-requests-remotely.md) from outside Shopify.
  - Manually via the "Copy and Execute" link on the requests admin page
  - From your storefront using Shopify's app proxy

- **Next Request**: You can implement [chained requests](../request-parameters/chained-requests.md) by setting the Next Request field to the handle of a request to run after this one completes.
