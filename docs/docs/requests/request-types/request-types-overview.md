# Request types overview

APIEase supports three request types. Pick the one that fits how you want to call external services or Shopify Flow.

- **[HTTP requests](./http-requests.md)**: Standard API calls to external services. You define the endpoint, method, headers, and body content.
- **[Flow requests](./flow-requests.md)**: Start or continue a Shopify Flow automation, optionally including data pulled from other API calls or the storefront.
- **[Liquid requests](./liquid-requests.md)**: Run a Liquid template that can call other APIEase requests and shape the output—helpful for logic or combining multiple requests without a custom app.

Use HTTP requests when you need a direct API call, Flow requests when the action should occur inside Shopify Flow, and Liquid requests when you need templating or conditional logic without a custom app.
