# Trigger requests from a webhook

This guide shows how to configure a webhook trigger in APIEase. Shopify maintains the full list of [webhook topics](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/2023-10/enums/WebhookSubscriptionTopic).

## Add a webhook trigger
1. In the APIEase admin, open the request (click the edit icon if needed).
2. In the **Trigger** column, click the plus icon.
3. Select **Webhook**.
4. Choose the Shopify webhook event (for example `orders/create`, `customers/update`, or `carts/update`).

After saving, APIEase will execute the request every time that event is received from Shopify.

## Example: webhook-triggered Flow request
If you want to start a Shopify Flow automation whenever a cart updates:
1. Create a new request and select **Flow** as the request type.
2. Choose your Flow template and fill required parameters.
3. Add a webhook trigger and select `carts/update`.

Each cart update triggers the request and starts the Flow. Any webhook fields you need can also be mapped into Flow input parameters.

## Webhook payload as body
When the request is triggered, the webhook payload is passed as the body.

- Base body (example from `discounts/create`):
```json
{
  "admin_graphql_api_id": "gid://shopify/DiscountAutomaticNode/1",
  "title": "Automatic free shipping",
  "status": "ACTIVE",
  "created_at": "2016-08-29T12:00:00-04:00",
  "updated_at": "2016-08-29T12:00:00-04:00"
}
```
- If you add body parameters, they are merged:
```json
{
  "admin_graphql_api_id": "gid://shopify/DiscountAutomaticNode/1",
  "title": "Automatic free shipping",
  "status": "ACTIVE",
  "created_at": "2016-08-29T12:00:00-04:00",
  "updated_at": "2016-08-29T12:00:00-04:00",
  "additional_body_parameter": "some_value"
}
```
- If your body parameters override a webhook field, the original is preserved with `_0` suffix:
```json
{
  "admin_graphql_api_id": "gid://shopify/DiscountAutomaticNode/1",
  "title": "Title that I prefer",
  "title_0": "Automatic free shipping",
  "status": "ACTIVE",
  "created_at": "2016-08-29T12:00:00-04:00",
  "updated_at": "2016-08-29T12:00:00-04:00"
}
```
