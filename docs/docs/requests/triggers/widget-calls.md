# Widget calls

Widgets are reusable storefront components managed inside APIEase. They can render UI and call requests. If you have not used widgets before, start with [Widgets overview](../../widgets/widgets-overview.md).

Widget Calls are a trigger type for APIEase requests. Use one when an APIEase widget should call the request from the storefront. This is the reusable-UI alternative to pasting a [storefront call](./storefont-calls.md) into theme Liquid.

## How it works
- The widget runs in the browser.
- The widget triggers the request.
- The request executes on the server and returns a response.

To configure the widget-side request call, see [Using Requests in Widgets](../../widgets/using-requests-in-widgets.md).

A widget is the reusable Liquid, CSS, and JavaScript component. The request remains a separate server-side resource, and **Widget Calls** authorizes that widget-side entry point. Choose a [Widget App Block](../../widgets/widget-app-block.md) to place the widget on a specific page or section, or a [Widget App Embed](../../widgets/widget-app-embed.md) for a widget that should load across the storefront.

## Passing values to Liquid requests
Widget JavaScript uses the same APIEase integration endpoint as storefront calls. For Liquid requests, set `requestId` to the request handle and pass per-call values with `liquidParamsEmbedded`.

`liquidParamsEmbedded` should contain a JSON object string. Inside the Liquid request, read those values from `apiEaseParameters.liquidParams.<parameterName>`.

## Security warning
Widgets run in the browser and are inspectable. Sensitive credentials must not be placed in widgets. Configure credentials inside the APIEase request where they are stored securely. Treat all widget inputs as untrusted.
