# Webhooks overview

Use Shopify webhooks to start APIEase requests automatically when store events occur. This is ideal for reacting in real time to orders, carts, customers, and other updates without polling. You can add a webhook trigger to any request. See the [Shopify webhook topics](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/2023-10/enums/WebhookSubscriptionTopic) for available events.

- Configure how to start requests from webhook events.

## [Mapping webhook parameters](./mapping-webhook-parameters.md)
- Map webhook payload fields into your request parameters.
