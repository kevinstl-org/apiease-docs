# Mapping webhook parameters

When a Shopify webhook triggers a request in APIEase, the full webhook payload is forwarded as the request body. You can map any field from that payload into query parameters, headers, or body fields that your endpoint expects.

**How mapping works**

Add a parameter to your request with:
- **Type**: Query, Header, or Body
- **Name**: The name expected by the destination endpoint
- **Value**: A reference to the webhook payload field, wrapped in curly braces

## Example: simple payload value
For the `products/delete` webhook, the payload includes:

```json
{
  "id": 788032119674292922
}
```

To send this value as a query parameter named `deleted_product_id`, add:
- Type: Query
- Name: `deleted_product_id`
- Value: `{id}`

This pulls the `id` field from the webhook and renders an address like `https://example.com?deleted_product_id=788032119674292922`.

## Example: nested payload value
If the value you need is nested, use dot notation. For the `product_listings/remove` webhook, the payload includes:

```json
{
  "product_listing": {
    "product_id": 788032119674292922
  }
}
```

To pass the nested `product_id` value to your endpoint, set the parameter value to `{product_listing.product_id}` (as a query, header, or body value depending on what the endpoint requires).

## Tips
- The webhook payload is already the request body; additional body parameters you add are merged into that body.
- Use descriptive parameter names so the rendered request matches what your downstream API expects.
