# Shop access token

The shop access token is the Shopify OAuth token issued when a shop installs APIEase. APIEase stores it per shop and uses it to call the Shopify Admin API on that shop's behalf.
If the shop access token does not have the permissions your request needs, you can adjust its permissions as described in [Manage shop access token permissions](./manage-shop-access-token-permissions.md).

You do not need to retrieve or reveal this installed token to use it. APIEase injects it into eligible requests during execution. APIEase does not provide the stored Shopify OAuth token for copying; if you require an explicit token, obtain a [custom access token](./custom-access-token.md) from Shopify.

## How APIEase uses it
- APIEase app usage: internal Shopify Admin API calls that APIEase makes for the shop use the shop access token.
- Automatic request usage: when a request targets a Shopify Admin API endpoint and you do not provide an override token, APIEase injects the shop access token automatically.
