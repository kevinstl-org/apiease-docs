# Chained requests

Chained requests allow you to call one request after another, using the response from the first request as input to the second. This is especially useful when working with systems that require multi-step interactions, such as authentication followed by data access.

For example, you might need to:

Authenticate with an external service

Receive an access token in the response

Use that token to make a second request to retrieve data or perform an action

**Setting Next Request**

Set the request id or request name of the next request you would like to call in the **Next Request** field.

**How Chaining Works in APIEase**

Each request in APIEase can optionally trigger another request once it completes. The second request can use values from the first request's response body as parameters.

Let's say you have two requests:

Request A: Authenticates with a service and receives a token

Request B: Uses that token to call a protected endpoint

Here's an example of what the JSON response from Request A might look like:

```json
{
  "auth": {
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9"
  }
}
```
In Request B, you can reference the token value using curly braces:

Authorization: Bearer {auth.token}
This tells APIEase to pull the token field from the auth object in the JSON response and insert it into the header of the second request.

**Flexible Use of Response Data**

You can use response values from Request A in multiple parts of Request B:

Query parameters

Headers

Request body

URL paths

For example, suppose Request A returns the following JSON:

```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": "abc123",
    "email": "user@example.com"
  }
}
```
You could then use those values in Request B like this:

In a query string: ?user_ref={user.id}

In a header: X-User-Email: {user.email}

In the body:

```json
{
  "ref_id": "{user.id}"
}
```
The curly brace syntax tells APIEase to substitute in the corresponding value from the previous response.

**A Real-World Example**

If you want to see this in action, we've created a walkthrough of a common use case: authenticating with a service, storing the returned access token, and using it in a follow-up request.

**When to Use Chained Requests**

Use chained requests when:

You need to authenticate before calling a protected API

You need to transform or fetch dynamic data before continuing

You want to build multi-step workflows inside APIEase without building and hosting a custom backend
