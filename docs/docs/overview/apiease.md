# APIEase

The API Integration And Automation Platform
===========================================

APIEase is a managed system where your API requests, workflows, and custom logic 
run, so you don’t have to build or maintain that infrastructure yourself.

**What It Does** - APIEase executes secure HTTP requests, triggers Shopify Flow 
actions, and runs custom logic defined through Liquid Requests. [Learn more...](./what-it-does.md)

**How It Works** - Add fully configurable HTTP, Shopify Flow, or Liquid Requests 
to APIEase, and trigger them manually, from your storefront, through webhooks, 
on a cron schedule, from an external HTTP client, or via a Proxy Endpoint. [Learn more...](./how-it-works.md)

**Why You Need It** - Use APIEase to integrate and serve API calls with custom 
logic and automation without having to build, maintain, or host the backend. 
It securely supplies confidential credentials to any request, allowing them 
to be triggered from your storefront or from external systems without exposing 
those credentials publicly. [Learn more...](./why-you-need-it.md)
