# How it works

Document the end-to-end path for a request inside APIEase:
- Where merchants create requests and store credentials.
- How triggers (Flow, webhooks, schedules) start executions.
- How responses flow back into Shopify or downstream APIs.

Use this as the canonical “mental model” page. Add diagrams or sequence steps once available.
