# APIEase Summary

Shopify gives you powerful tools to run an online store, but it does not provide a way to securely call external APIs that require confidential parameters. This limitation affects both storefront interactions and automated workflows.

APIEase fills this gap by allowing you to make secure, authenticated API requests and integrate with Shopify Flow without needing to build your own Shopify app.

All calls from APIEase originate from a [static ip address](https://apiease.tawk.help/article/apiease-ip-address-for-whitelisting) for external systems that require whitelisted ip addresses.

**HTTP API Integration**

With APIEase, you can securely call third-party APIs directly from your storefront. These requests can include sensitive credentials or parameters that cannot be exposed to the browser.

**Shopify Flow Integration**

APIEase also works seamlessly with Shopify Flow. Integration with Flow allows you to implement logic-based workflows within the APIEase ecosystem.

You can initiate a standalone workflow or execute secure API calls before or after triggering a workflow, with the ability to use the response from each Flow or API request as part of your automation.

**Why It Matters**

Without APIEase, securely connecting Shopify to external systems requires building and hosting a private app. That means more time, more cost, and more maintenance.

APIEase removes that burden. It gives merchants and developers a straightforward way to make secure API calls, connect with third-party systems, and build powerful automations.
