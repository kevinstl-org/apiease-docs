# Request types overview

APIEase supports three request types. Pick the one that fits how you want to call external services or Shopify Flow.

- **HTTP requests**: Standard API calls to external services. You define the endpoint, method, headers, and body content.
- **Liquid requests**: Run a Liquid template that can call other APIEase requests and shape the output—helpful for logic or combining multiple requests without a custom app.
- **Shopify Flow requests**: Start or continue a Shopify Flow automation, optionally including data pulled from other API calls or the storefront.

Use HTTP requests when you need a direct API call, Liquid requests when you need templating or conditional logic, and Shopify Flow requests when the action should occur inside Flow.
